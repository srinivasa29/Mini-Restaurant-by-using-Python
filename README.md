# Mini-Restaurant-by-using-Python
This Project is a simple Python-based restaurant ordering system. It uses a predefined menu to allow users to select food items, validates their input, calculates the total bill, and displays the order summary interactively. Perfect for learning input handling, conditionals, and dictionary operations!
